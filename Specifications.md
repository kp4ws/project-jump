## Product Overview.

  

1.  **Purpose Of The Product:**

  

The main purpose of the product is to create an easy but fun, working game that can be enjoyed by a wide range of people.

  

2.  **Target Audience:**

  

The target audience is a wide range of people, since the game has core features that can be enjoyed by younger audiences while also including more challenging additional features for people who are older.

  

3.  **Theme:**

  

The game is a 2d vertical procedurally generated platformer with 3d artstyle for most elements, giving it a unique look. It also includes various mechanics which enhance gameplay, such as health and abilities, with a fully functional shop.

  

4.  **Goals:**

  

- Set up working procedural generation.

- Set up a shop for the user to buy from.

- Implement two to 4 abilties for the player to use

- Add custom blocks and further change how the map generates

- Add basic traps.

- Set up a function HUD with key elements.

  

## Flow of the game.

  

The game starts with the player on the ground, the lowest level, and the player jumps from platform to platform to go as high as possible. The game has a fall damage mechanic which removes the players health when they fall for longer than a certain amount of time, based on how long they fall, which acts as the main death mechanic. When the player dies, the game is over and the player gets sent back to the bottom. Every run the player earns coins based on height traversed, which can be used in the shop to buy abilities and extra health, before starting the next run.

  

## Game Features.

  

1.  **HUD.**

  

The player will have a Heads Up Display on their screen, which shows their score/ or currency and their health. It will also include their abilities.

  

## Game Levels.

  

1.  **Main Tower.**

  

This is the main tower of the game, which the player is trying to climb. It is procedurally generated using code we made, which ensures that there are some challenges in jumps while also making sure that all jumps are possible. The player jumps up from one platform to another, gaining score and currency to spend in the shop to buy game changing abilities to boost their high score.

2.  **Shop.**

  

This is present at the start of the tower, and the player can go here to buy abilities and items. The abilities will be on the floor and players can use their currency to buy abilities.

  

## Key Items.

  

1.  **Main Player.**

  

This is the player of the game. It is a 2d sprite with basic animations and a charge jump mechanic.

  

2.  **JetPack.**

  

This is one of the abilities purchasable in the game. It runs on limited fuel which can be refilled with pickups present in the map, and allows the player to fly up, or negate fall damage if they miss a jump.

  

3.  **Basic Spike Trap.**

  

This is just a spike trap on some platforms which damage the player when they touch it.

  
  

## Priority Levels.

  

1.  **Core**.

  

The core features are the procedural generation, the HUD, and a crude shop with one ability, and an option to buy extra health, the player health and death mechanic and currency to spend in the shop.

  

2.  **Secondary.**

  

The secondary features include a well designed shop, with more abilities, better procedural generation (obstacles in the way or to stand on), more refined textures for the tower and background, music for the game, particle effects, basic traps and different platform types.

  

3.  **Nice to have features.**

  

More abilities, multiple levels, more platform types, bosses, more traps would be nice to have in the game, as they would improve gameplay a lot.

  

## Non-Functional Requirements.

  

1.  **Performance Requirements.**

  

The system needs to be able to run unreal engine 5 on it for the game to work.

The game should work in most cases, since it is not a large game.

  

3.  **Software Quality Requirements**.

Unreal Engine 5.3, Visual Studio Code 2022 are the main software you will need.

  
  

4.  **Saftey and Security Requirements.**

  

The game does not need any saftey or security requirments as it is a small game with no online play.
